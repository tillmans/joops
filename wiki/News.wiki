== Oops! 0.9.1 Released ==
_November 5, 2007_

Oops! 0.9.1 has been released with some awesome fixes.  I haven't been working a lot on this project, but I'm still happy with it.  I had the opportunity to discuss it with some friends at a software convention recently, and it revived my interest in it.  I noticed that there are some bugs, and they are fixed!  There is a new feature or two for you to explore as well.  Please see the ChangeLog for more information.

== Oops! 0.9 Released ==
_May 17, 2007_

Oops! 0.9 has now been released.  This new version introduces a scripting interface for integration with your application, build, or testing process.  See more information in the ChangeLog.

== Getting ready for 0.9 ==
_April 25, 2007_

I have been working on updates for 0.9.  Planned features:
 * Scripting interface: use Oops! from Java, Beanshell, Groovy, etc. in addition to running it as a standalone program.
 * Better threading: interrupt handling (flag interrupts, stop processing, etc.)
 * !DependencyVisitor interface for custom scripting
 * Utility class for launching an analysis (may refactor Main class name and merge this)
