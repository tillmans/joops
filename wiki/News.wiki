#summary News about the project
== Getting ready for 0.9 ==
_April 25, 2007_

I have been working on updates for 0.9.  Planned features:
 * Scripting interface: use Oops! from Java, Beanshell, Groovy, etc. in addition to running it as a standalone program.
 * Better threading: interrupt handling (flag interrupts, stop processing, etc.)
 * !DependencyVisitor interface for custom scripting
 * Utility class for launching an analysis (may refactor Main class name and merge this)

I have created a news page to post status updates, heartbeats, or other things about the project as I see fit.
