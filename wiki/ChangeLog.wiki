#summary The change log for Oops.
#labels Featured
= 0.9.1 =
 * Logging: you may now turn on java.util.Logging support for your scripted Analyzer by calling setLogging(true).  Optionally, you can pass in a Logger to use to override the default logger.  This may be convenient if you want to wrap other logging systems such as Log4J.
 * Some bugs fixed with class path expansion: the Analyzer no longer assumes that non-.class files are JARs.  This fix also removes the ugly IOException checked exception from Analyzer constructors.
 * A new usage option.  Try invoking the Analyzer from the command line with -h or --help!
 * It was available before, but now officially endorsed: split output.  Send successfully loaded classes to STDOUT and failures to STDERR, to be captured independently.
